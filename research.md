**The Effects of Tax Enforcement on the Firm Size Distribution and Aggregate Productivity (Job Market Paper)** <a href="/assets/Paper_Tax_Enforcement.pdf" target="_blank">Draft</a><br>
_How does tax enforcement affect the firm size distribution and total factor productivity (TFP)? To answer this question, I develop a quantitative model characterized by heterogeneous agents who choose whether to be workers, entrepreneurs in the formal sector, or entrepreneurs in the informal sector. Informal entrepreneurs do not pay taxes, but face a probability of detection that is increasing in firm size. In the model, stricter tax enforcement results in lower informality and affects the firm size distribution and TFP through two mechanisms. First, some relatively unproductive agents choose to be workers rather than entrepreneurs, leading to higher average productivity and firm size through a composition effect. Second, some entrepreneurs switch to the formal sector and expand their scale compared to informal entrepreneurs of the same productivity. Using data from Brazil, I calibrate the model and estimate that a counterfactual tax enforcement that reduces the informality rate from 36% to 30% of total output - the value measured in the weighted average of the six largest Latin American economies - would account for about 9% and 28% of the observed differences in TFP and average firm size._

**Measuring Informal GDP Using Survey Data** <a href="/assets/Paper_Informality_Measurement.pdf" target="_blank">Draft</a><br>
_This paper estimates the share of informal GDP in 26 developing countries over a period that spans up to 2004â€“2023. The focus is on the concept of legal informality, defined as the activities of enterprises that are not formally registered. I propose a simple framework that formally characterizes informal GDP. I use data from various sources, including the World Bank Enterprise Survey and the International Labour Organization (ILO), to match the conditions derived from the framework. The resulting informality series conform to patterns documented in previous research, such as a negative correlation with GDP per capita and mild anticyclical behavior. Because I adopt a narrower definition of informality, the estimated levels tend to be lower than those reported in previous cross-country studies._
